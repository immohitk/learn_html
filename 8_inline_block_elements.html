:>>> HTML elements are generally divided into two categories:



    1.            INLINE ELEMENTS
    
    :- Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
    :- Inline elements can contain other inline elements, but they generally should not contain block-level elements is typically considered incorrect HTML and could lead to unexpected behavior in terms of layout and styling.


    #---Common Inline Elements

    1. <span>: A generic inline container for text
    2. <a>: Defines a hyperlink
    3. <strong>: Defines important text
    4. <em>: Defines emphasized text
    5. <img>: Embeds an image
    6. <input>: Defines an input control
    7. others : <a>, <abbr>, <acronym>, <button>, <br>, <big>, <bdo>, <b>, <cite>, <code>, <dfn>, <i>, <em>, <img>, <input>, <kbd>, <label>, <map>, <object>, <output>, <tt>, <time>, <samp>, <script>, <select>, <small>, <span>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <textarea>






    2.             BLOCK-LEVEL ELEMENTS
    
    :- Block-level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by default.
    :- Block-level elements essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line.



     #---Characteristics of Block-level Elements:

    1. Always start on a new line.
    2. Take up the full width available.
    3. Width and height can be controlled via CSS.
