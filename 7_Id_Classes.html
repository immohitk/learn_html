                    HTML Id & Classes

    :- Two of the most commonly used selectors are IDs and Classes.

    

                    ID
    
    :- An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page. 
    :- It is often used for unique styling and JavaScript manipulations.



                    CLASSES

    :- The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements.
    :- It can easily change their look or behavior all at once.
    :- Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements.
    :- It is generally used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements.
    


                    Differences Between IDs and Classes

    :- Uniqueness :- IDs are unique, and classes can be reused.
    :- JavaScript :- IDs are often used for JavaScript operations.
    :- Styling    :- Both can be used for styling, but IDs have higher specificity.
