                    HTML Attributes

    :- HTML attributes are used to define the characteristics of an HTML element.
    :- They are placed within the element's opening tag and consist of two parts: the name and the value.

    Name:  Specifies the property for that element.
    Value: Sets the value of that property for the element.




                        Types of HTML Attributes

    1. Core Attributes: These are basic attributes that can be applied to most HTML elements. Examples include id, class, and style.
    2. Internationalization Attributes: These attributes help adapt the document to different languages and regions. Examples include lang and dir.
    3. Generic Attributes: These attributes provide additional information about the element but don't necessarily affect its appearance or behavior.





    Core attributes are some of the most widely used attributes in HTML. There are four main types:

    a. ID Attribute
    :- The ID attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to an HTML element

    b. Class Attribute
    :- The class attribute is used to associate an HTML element with a particular class, typically for styling or JavaScript manipulation

    c. Title Attribute
    :- The title attribute provides additional information about an element and is often displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over it

    d. Style Attribute
    :- The style attribute allows for inline styling of HTML elements. It is used in conjunction with CSS properties to directly style individual elements within the HTML code.





                        Case Sensitivity 
    
    :- The HTML standard is flexible about the case of attribute names, allowing them to be written in either uppercase or lowercase
