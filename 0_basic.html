   HTML [ HyperText Markup Language ] Basics

   :- created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991
   :- used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images
   :- forms the backbone of web content or the skeleton of a website
   :- a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage
   :- consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files typically have either a ".html" or ".htm" extension.
   :- There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version.


   Features of HTML

   :- It is platform-independent. For example, Chrome displays the same pages identically across different operating systems
   :- HTML is a markup language and not a programming language
   :- can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc. to show interactive (or dynamic) web pages



   NOTE

   :- The term 'Hypertext Markup Language' is composed of two main words: 'hypertext' and 'markup language.' 'Hypertext' refers to the linking of text with other documents, while 'markup language' denotes a language that utilizes a specific set of tags.
      Thus, HTML is the practice of displaying text, graphics, audio, video etc. in a certain way using special tags.
